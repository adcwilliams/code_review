Python code should be be compatible with **Python 3.6** or later and developed
according to the recommendations of the
[PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide. The `Pylint`
package should be used to test compliance.

Tests should use the `Pytest` package and cover all functional elements.
